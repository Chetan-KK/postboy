## JSON Editing

- JSON in the request body is automatically formatted and highlighted
- Invalid JSON will be preserved as-is until it becomes valid
- Formatting occurs dynamically as you type and when you click away from the editor

## Request Processing

When a request is sent:
- A loading overlay with spinner appears to indicate that the request is being processed
- All interactive UI elements are temporarily disabled to prevent multiple concurrent requests
- Once the response is received or an error occurs, the UI is automatically re-enabled

## CORS Warning

Browser security policies may prevent cross-origin requests to APIs that don't support CORS. For testing such APIs, consider:

- Using a CORS proxy
- Testing in a development environment with CORS disabled
- Using a browser extension that bypasses CORS for testing purposes

## Technical Details

This is a pure frontend implementation built with:
- HTML5
- CSS3 (with CSS variables for theming)
- Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)
- Fetch API for making HTTP requests
- Highlight.js for syntax highlighting

No additional libraries or frameworks are required.

## Running the Project

Simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser to start using the application. You can also host the files on any static web server.
